# supertroupers

strategy RPG (Running Poetry Generator) built in rust.

# OK, how do I install it?
TWO WAYS!
1) Install the Rust programming language for whatever platform you run (Windows, Linux, MacOS),
	`git clone https://github.com/minauteur/supertroupers.git` and then `cd supertroupers`
	before finally `cargo run`-ing from the supertroupers directory.
2) Download the Windows binary here: https://microwavemansion.com/supertroupers-alpha.zip, unzip the contents to a folder (for now, it's just three files--names.json, poems.txt, and supertroupers.exe)
	and run the .exe!

# OK, but how do I play it?
1) Search for an author... or don't
2) Search for a title... or don't 
3) Write infinity poetries!

## --a note!
be careful making highly generic searches! It takes a minute or two for all the material to come back/to generate poems when that's the case, but it should still work. 
Just chill a bit while the beatniks do they thang!

Finally, DO let me know if anything breaks or sucks super hard so I can try to fix those things in the fundamental code before we move on to adding graphics and other bells and whistles!
TWEET ME YOUR POEMS!
